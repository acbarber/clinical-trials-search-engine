Despite the progress done in the last decade,\\n      approximately 50% of STS patients still develop distant metastases within 3 years from the\\n      diagnosis and die from their disease. Doxorubicin (or epirubicin) and ifosfamide have been\\n      proved to be active in the treatment of STS and they are widely used, alone or in\\n      combination, as a first line therapy for locally advanced and metastatic patients. However,\\n      the response rate to the combination regimen in non-pretreated patients does not exceed\\n      30-40%, and large randomized clinical trials failed to demonstrate any advantage in survival\\n      for the combination compared to single-agent treatment. Trabectedin (Yondelis®) is a\\n      marine-derived anticancer agent that has been approved in the European Union as a single\\n      agent for the treatment of STS patients after failure of standard chemotherapy (doxorubicin\\n      and/or ifosfamide) or for those unsuited to receive these agents. Even if the response rate\\n      in soft tissue sarcoma does not exceed 10%, trabectedin can provide a significant clinical\\n      benefit, by arresting disease progression in almost 50% of treated patients, with a\\n      progression-free survival rate of 20% at 6 months. Trabectedin was found to be particularly\\n      active in the treatment of myxoid liposarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma, for which better\\n      results have been obtained in terms of response rate and survival, suggesting an histotype\\n      driven activity. The toxicity profile of trabectedin given as second line therapy has been\\n      widely assessed in clinical studies and was largely manageable, with the majority of adverse\\n      events being grade 1 or 2 toxicities, generally reversible, dose or time dependent and\\n      noncumulative. The good tolerability profile observed in the trials seems to be confirmed\\n      also in everyday clinical practice. Conversely, few data are available at the moment about\\n      tolerability profile for those patients treated with trabectedin as first line because of\\n      medical conditions contraindicating the use of standard agents.

However, it frequently leads to sore mouth, tummy pain and increased risk of\\n      developing infections.\\n\\n      The investigators try to save or \"rescue\" normal cells from the side effects of methotrexate\\n      by giving a drug called folinic acid. Folinic acid is started 24 hours after methotrexate\\n      and given regularly until methotrexate levels are really low and not dangerous to normal\\n      cells anymore. Despite this rescue, side effects are still a problem and many patients are\\n      not well enough to receive subsequent chemotherapy on time. Almost half of the planned\\n      chemotherapy cycles are not given on time due to methotrexate side effects.\\n\\n      In this study the investigators will examine if adding a drug called glucarpidase to folinic\\n      acid is helpful. Glucarpidase is an enzyme that inactivates methotrexate in the blood\\n      stream. Lower methotrexate concentration in the blood stream leads to fewer side effects.\\n      The investigators would like to see if glucarpidase helps patients to have their\\n      chemotherapy on time, by reducing the side effects of methotrexate.\\n    \\n      In this study the patient will receive 4 courses of high-dose methotrexate. High-dose\\n      methotrexate is normally given at weekly intervals, in blocks of two.The first two courses\\n      will be given on weeks 1 & 2; the second two courses on weeks 4 & 5. Two courses will be\\n      given with folinic acid rescue (standard high-dose methotrexate), and the other two will be\\n      given with glucarpidase rescue as well as folinic acid. This will enable us to compare\\n      whether there is any difference in side effects with and without glucarpidase and also how\\n      quickly patients recover from them.\\n\\n      Half of the patients will receive standard high-dose methotrexate on weeks 1 & 2 and\\n      high-dose methotrexate with glucarpidase on weeks 4 & 5 (arm A) and half of the patients\\n      will first have high-dose methotrexate with glucarpidase on weeks 1 & 2 and then standard\\n      high-dose methotrexate on weeks 4 & 5 (arm B).\\n\\n      All patients receiving methotrexate have daily blood tests to monitor the levels of\\n      methotrexate in their body, and monitor their kidney function.

Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the\\n      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin hydrochloride\\n      and ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing\\n      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation\\n      therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate, combination\\n      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may be an effective treatment for soft tissue\\n      sarcoma.\\n    \\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\\n\\n      I. To determine the pathologic response rate (>= 95% necrosis) after preoperative treatment\\n      with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate), epirubicin (epirubicin hydrochloride), ifosfamide, and\\n      hypofractionated radiation for high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body\\n      wall.\\n\\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\\n\\n      I. To further characterize the safety of sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy, including wound\\n      complication rate.\\n\\n      II. To estimate time-to-event rates, including overall survival, overall disease-free\\n      survival, distant disease-free survival, and local disease-free survival in patients with\\n      high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body wall treated with preoperative\\n      sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy and postoperative sorafenib plus chemotherapy.\\n\\n      OUTLINE:\\n\\n      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-71 and 85-155,\\n      epirubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes, and ifosfamide IV over 90\\n      minutes on days 15-17, 36-38 (ifosfamide only), 57-59, 99-101, 120-122, and 141-143.\\n      Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on days 36-45 and surgical resection\\n      on day 78.

Phase I enrollment has been closed.\\n\\n      Phase 2: To determine the clinical benefit of ganetespib in combination with sirolimus for\\n      patients with unresectable or metastatic sporadic or NF1 associated MPNST.\\n    \\n      Previously, no targeted agents have been able to cause tumor regression in a genetically\\n      engineered MPNST mouse model or human MPNST. Recently published data from Dr. Cichowski's\\n      laboratory demonstrated using Hsp90 inhibitors to enhance endoplasmic reticulum stress\\n      coupled with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus led to dramatic\\n      tumor shrinkage in a transgenic MPNST mouse model, which correlated with profound damage to\\n      the endoplasmic reticulum and cell death. Ganetespib is a novel, injectable, small molecule\\n      inhibitor of Hsp90 and is currently being investigated in adults with a broad range of tumor\\n      types with a favorable safety profile and promising early results. Ganetespib has been\\n      studied in preclinical in vivo models with a variety of targeted agents with no marked\\n      apparent pharmacological interactions. Sirolimus is a commercially available orally\\n      administered mTOR inhibitor and is the active metabolite of temsirolimus, which is FDA\\n      approved agent for advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Sirolimus has been studied and\\n      tolerated in combination with multiple cytotoxic and targeted agents in a variety of tumor\\n      types. Based on strong preclinical rationale, the investigators hypothesize that ganetespib\\n      in combination with sirolimus will cause tumor regression in patients with refractory\\n      MPNSTs.\\n\\n      The investigators propose a multi-institutional open label phase I/II trial of ganetespib in\\n      combination with sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcoma including MPNST. Hsp90\\n      inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors have also both demonstrated benefit in a variety of\\n      preclinical bone and soft tissue sarcoma models. The investigators hypothesize that these\\n      agents that work on separate and potentially synergistic pathways will also be beneficial\\n      for other refractory bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Thus, the phase I component will be open\\n      to patients with refractory sarcomas, which will also expedite enrollment. Upon\\n      determination of the recommended dosing, a phase II study will be conducted. The phase II\\n      study population will be limited to patients with a diagnosis of MPNST.\\n    \", 'name': 'https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02008877'}>]\n"
